# GitHub CI/CD Setup Complete

This project now has a complete CI/CD setup that will require passing unit tests before merging code.

## Files Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Runs on pushes and pull requests to `main`, `master`, and `develop` branches
- **Java Versions**: Tests against Java 8, 11, and 17
- **Features**:
  - Caches Maven dependencies for faster builds
  - Runs `mvn clean test` using the Maven wrapper
  - Uploads test results as artifacts for debugging
  - Uses Ubuntu latest runner

### 2. Maven Wrapper Files
- **`mvnw`** (Unix/Linux script)
- **`mvnw.cmd`** (Windows script)
- **`.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`** (Maven wrapper configuration)

### 3. Documentation
- **`.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`** - Instructions for setting up branch protection rules
- **`GITHUB_CI_SETUP.md`** - This summary document

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Files
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI workflow and Maven wrapper"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Branch Protection Rules
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings > Branches**
3. Click **"Add rule"** for your main branch
4. Configure the following:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
     - Search for: `test` (this will find our CI job)
   - ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**

### 3. Test the Setup
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b test-ci`
2. Make a change that breaks a test
3. Commit and push: `git commit -am "Break test" && git push origin test-ci`
4. Create a pull request
5. Verify that the PR shows failing tests and cannot be merged
6. Fix the test and push again
7. Verify that the PR can now be merged

## How It Works

1. **Developer creates PR** → GitHub Actions automatically runs tests
2. **Tests pass** → PR can be merged (if other requirements are met)
3. **Tests fail** → PR cannot be merged until tests are fixed
4. **Multiple Java versions** → Ensures compatibility across different Java versions

## Benefits

- ✅ **Prevents broken code** from being merged
- ✅ **Ensures code quality** through automated testing
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** with Maven wrapper
- ✅ **Fast builds** with dependency caching
- ✅ **Easy debugging** with test result artifacts
- ✅ **Multiple Java version support** for compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### If Maven wrapper doesn't work:
- Ensure the files are committed to Git
- Check file permissions (Unix systems)
- Verify the `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` file is correct

### If tests fail in CI but pass locally:
- Check Java version differences
- Verify Maven dependencies are properly cached
- Look at the test result artifacts for detailed error information

### If branch protection isn't working:
- Ensure the status check name matches exactly (`test`)
- Verify the branch protection rule is applied to the correct branch
- Check that the CI workflow is running successfully
